# simon-game

Simon game based on the web bootcamp of Angela Yu in udemy. 
Coding is slightly different than the shown on the curriculum, as I tried to complete it myself without following the instructions.
Must be working without a problem.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery

Issue 1 : on mobile browsers audio files are playing with delay, need a fix in the future. preload might be a solution.
Issue 2 : on mobile browsers, for better perception, button animations could be longer.
